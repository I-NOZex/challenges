# Chasing Ghosts Challenge

Imagine two players, side by side, playing a classic arcade game, using professional arcade controllers, fighting for the best score, and keep climbing their way into the great final.

We’ll be using the single-elimination tournament system with four rounds. Sixteen players in the first round, then eight for the quarterfinals, then four for the semifinals and then finally, two lucky players will dispute the final. On every round, the computer will pick the opponents randomly.
