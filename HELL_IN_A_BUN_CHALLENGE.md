Pixels Camp is all about challenges — mental, physical, and… culinary.

Yes, you read that right. We have a grand tradition to uphold where it regards spicy food competitions, but we wanted to reinvent it in a way that would be both more fun and more Portuguese, so we turned to our friends over at EatTasty, who came up with the idea of turning the typical Portuguese bifana into a powerful, er… delivery mechanism.

## We Need One Hundred Heros (and some)

Our mischevious plan is to gather 104 volunteers, feed them increasingly spicy bifanas and pick a lone courageous winner, who will bask in the inner glory (pun intended) of having been fed the best spicy bifanas in the country.
Our gourmet chefs will prepare a four-course menu, served with natural yoghurt sauce (seasoned with the finest chives) and plenty of liquid yoghurts to go around. And all you have to do is eat, taste, and… last the course.

## The Rules

The rules are simple:

 * You’ll need to be the first to finish your bifana (hey, I can do that, you’re thinking…)
 * You’ll have to endure 20 seconds after eating (it’s not that easy…)
 * If you have a drink, then you’re disqualified (and believe us, you’ll want one…)
 * The bifanas will get spicier on each round (the spice must flow!)

So out of those 104, we’ll pick 52, then 26, etc.

But we will definitely make it worth your while — the bifanas will not just become spicier, they will also become more elaborate and tastier as the challenge progresses!

## The Menu

 * **Spicy Novice Taster**: Pork in Carcaça (typical Portuguese Bread), anointed with traditional spicy sauce and piri-piri. (Serves 104)
 * **Spicy Amateur Taster**: Pork in Chinese bread, with a gourmet mix of Habanero peppers. (Serves 52)
 * **Spicy Skilled Taster**: Pork in Chinese bread, seasoned with Bhut Jolokia or Trinidad Moruga Scorpion (or both) (Serves 26)
 * **Spicy Master Taster**: An exquisite gourmet bifana, served with clams in steamed bread and seasoned with the chef’s special blend. (Serves 4)

Yummy, huh?

If you think you have what it takes then...
